In ENGR 021: Computer Engineering Fundamentals, you will learn how to teach a computer to do things that engineers need to do using Python. No prior knowledge of programming is assumed, so this will be a 'first course in programming for engineers' at Swarthmore. You will learn how to program computers (such as a laptop or desktop) and microcontrollers (such as the Circuit Playground Express) to manipulate information and perform tasks relevant to engineering, and to develop your sense of 'computational thinking'. You will also learn how to use basic numerical methods that are commonly used in engineering. The course can (conceptually) be divided into three parts:
* Introduction to programming 
* Using a microcontroller to observe and manipulate the environment
* Numerical techniques and their applications to engineering
