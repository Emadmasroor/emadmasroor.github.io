## Labs

The labs for this class will be self-scheduled.

More details to follow...


## Policies

### Class meetings
This course will be conducted in the form of (in-person) lectures during the regularly scheduled meeting times (i.e., Mondays and Wednesdays at 11:45 AM for 75 minutes per class meeting). Students are expected to attend every class meeting and take notes. The instructor will make available the lecture notes developed in class, but these do not replace the need for students to actively engage with the material, ideally by taking their own notes. Please be respectful of everyone else's time by being punctual. You must not use cell phones or laptop computers during class, but you are permitted to take notes on a tablet or tablet-like device. Note that you need explicit permission of the instructor to take notes on your laptop, and such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If you must use your cell phone during class, you may excuse yourself from the classroom.

### Exams
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam for this course. You should expect the midterm to be held around spring break, and you should expect the final to be a **take-home exam** which you can complete over a 24-hour period of your choosing during finals week. The final exam will be cumulative. 

#### Missed Exams
If you miss an exam without prior notice, it will not be rescheduled. If you need to take an exam at an alternate time for any reason, you must request this in writing at least one week prior to the scheduled exam. Such a request will be granted on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. 

### Homework 
Homework assignments are an integral part of this course. You should expect to turn in approximately 12 homework assignments over the course of the semester. These assignments will collectively serve as a written document testifying to your ability to solve problems in nonlinear dynamics. As such, you should strive to turn in your best work.

- Your submissions should be in PDF format, either typeset on your computer or handwritten and neatly scanned. 
- Although you will need to write code to solve some problems, your code will typically not be graded. You may, however, be asked to submit your code as an appendix.
- Diagrams should be 'publication-quality' whenever feasible. At a minimum, they should  include all axis labels and legends where appropriate, and should use a font size that is large enough to be legible. You should pay attention to the thickness of lines, the shape of markers, and the contrast between colors.

Due dates are strict on the timescale of days (e.g., you can't normally submit a homework assignment a day or two late) but flexible on the time scale of an hour (i.e., you can typically submit a homework assignment up to an hour-ish after the deadline and still 'have it count' as if it was submitted on time. A penalty of 50\%  will be applied for late homework assignments, and they will not be accepted more than seven days after the deadline. The purpose of the 50\% penalty is two-fold: it eliminates the need for negotiations about exactly what happens when you miss a deadline, and it encourages you to stick to the deadlines to stay on track. You get one `free' one-week extension to use at any time in the semester by invoking this policy in an email to the instructor any time before the deadline.

### Collaboration and Attribution
Working together with others on homework assignments is acceptable and even encouraged. However, what you submit must either be entirely your own work, or clearly name your collaborators. If you worked closely enough with a fellow student that you suspect your solutions will be substantially similar, you should attribute each other on your homework on the front page with a statement like "I worked together with X on problem 2". You are also encouraged to attribute online resources if you use them.

### Artificial Intelligence 
With the widespread availability of Large Language Models and other general-purpose artificial intelligence tools, you now have access to a powerful piece of technology that has the potential to drastically change the way we obtain information. At the same time, these tools threaten to reshape our relationship to _knowledge_ and _understanding_, and some of these changes are inimical to the values of a college. With this in mind, note that

- You are not prohibited from using these tools --- the same way you would use a search engine or an online forum --- to help you answer questions when you are studying for this class. 
- You are encouraged to use these tools creatively to aid in your understanding. If you have a question about the topics you are learning about in this course and you 'ask an AI', you may get a good answer. But to get a _really_ good answer, you'll need to know how to write a good question, which takes some practice.
- Large Language Models are essentially very sophisticated plagiarism machines. After ingesting everything that humans have ever written that's on the internet, these tools can regurgitate this information by sequentially predicting the 'best' words in a given 'conversation'.
- AI is (still) often wrong. There are many reasons for this, but it's important to note that there are basically no guarantees against against finding something wrong on a Google search or a ChatGPT query. 
- Everything you turn in for this class must be your own work. Asking an AI tool how to solve a homework or exam problem, and then turning in that solution in your own words is a violation of academic integrity and will be treated as such. In this, AI tools are no different than using Chegg or StackExchange to find out how to solve a problem.


### Assessment

Your grade will consist of the following components:

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Homework  | 25%    |
| Midterm   | 25%    |
| Final     | 35%    |
| Lab       | 15%    |

The thresholds for this class will be as follows:

| Letter grade 	| Min. score |
|---------------|------------|
| A-		| 80	     |	
| B-		| 70	     |	
| C-		| 60	     |	
| D-		| 50	     |
