Welcome to the website for E91: Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos!

## General Information

- **Class meeting times**: MW 11:45 AM --- 1:00 PM in Singer 221
- **Instructor**: Emad Masroor
- **Office Hours**: M 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
- **Labs**: Self-scheduled, TBA 
- **Grader**: Brandon Mickelson [bmickel1@swarthmore.edu](mailto:bmickel1@swarthmore.edu)


## Textbook

This course will follow the classic textbook by Strogatz. It is available in two equally acceptable editions:

- Strogatz, S. H. (2018). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United States: CRC Press.
- Strogatz, S. (2024). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United Kingdom: CRC Press.

The Swarthmore textbook store stocks copies of this book; meanwhile, Cornell library holds copies in reserve. You can also find electronic copies on the internet. However, **you must have a physical copy** of your own for the duration of the semester.

## Lectures Diary
