Welcome to the website for E91: Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos!

## General Information

- **Class meeting times**: MW 11:45 AM --- 1:00 PM in Singer 221
- **Instructor**: Emad Masroor
- **Office Hours**: M 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
- **Labs**: Self-scheduled, TBA 
- **Grader**: Brandon Mickelson [bmickel1@swarthmore.edu](mailto:bmickel1@swarthmore.edu)


## Textbook

This course will follow the classic textbook by Strogatz. It is available in two equally acceptable editions:

- Strogatz, S. H. (2018). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United States: CRC Press.
- Strogatz, S. (2024). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United Kingdom: CRC Press.

The Swarthmore textbook store stocks copies of this book; meanwhile, Cornell library holds copies in reserve. You can also find electronic copies on the internet. However, **you must have a physical copy** of your own for the duration of the semester.

## Labs

The labs for this class will be self-scheduled. This means that you should expect to spend the same amount of time doing 'lab work' that you would in any other ENGR class at Swarthmore, but you will be able to do this work at your own pace.
