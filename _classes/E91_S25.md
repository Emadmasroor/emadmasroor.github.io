## Textbook

This course will follow the classic textbook by Strogatz. It is available in two equally acceptable editions:

- Strogatz, S. H. (2018). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United States: CRC Press.
- Strogatz, S. (2024). Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. United Kingdom: CRC Press.

The Swarthmore textbook store stocks copies of this book; meanwhile, Cornell library holds copies in reserve. You can also find electronic copies on the internet. However, **you must have a physical copy** of your own for the duration of the semester.

## Labs

The labs for this class will be self-scheduled. This means that you should expect to spend the same amount of time doing 'lab work' that you would in any other ENGR class at Swarthmore, but you this may happen in a less structured way than you're used to.

More details to follow...


## Policies

### Class meetings
This course will be conducted in the form of (in-person) lectures during the regularly scheduled meeting times (i.e., Mondays and Wednesdays at 11:45 AM for 75 minutes per class meeting). Students are expected to attend every class meeting and take notes. The instructor will make available the lecture notes developed in class, but these do not replace the need for students to actively engage with the material, ideally by taking their own notes. Please be respectful of everyone else's time by being punctual. You must not use cell phones or laptop computers during class, but you are permitted to take notes on a tablet or tablet-like device. Note that you need explicit permission of the instructor to take notes on your laptop, and such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If you must use your cell phone during class, you may excuse yourself from the classroom.

### Exams
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam for this course. You should expect the midterm to be held around spring break, and you should expect the final to be a **take-home exam** which you can complete over a 24-hour period of your choosing during finals week. The final exam will be cumulative.

### Homework 
Homework assignments are an integral part of this course. You should expect to turn in approximately 10 homework assignments over the course of the semester. These assignments will collectively serve as a written document testifying to your ability to solve problems in nonlinear dynamics. As such, you should strive to turn in your best work.

- Your submissions should be in PDF format, either typeset on your computer or handwritten and neatly scanned. 
- Although you will need to write code to solve some problems, your code will typically not be graded. You may, however, be asked to submit your code as an appendix.
- If you are required to produce diagrams that are programmatically generated, you are expected to adhere to the highest standards of figure presentation


### Assessment

Your grade will consist of the following components:

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Homework  | 25%    |
| Midterm   | 25%    |
| Final     | 35%    |
| Lab       | 15%    |
