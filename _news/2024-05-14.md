I have written two case studies for the final assessment of the <b>PCAP</b> module titled <b>Reflective Teaching in Higher Education</b>: 

- The first case study <a href="https://www.silviofanzon.com/assets/pdf/news/2024/Fanzon_Case_Study_1.pdf">(Link)</a> addresses how I have employed a range of methods, approaches, and digital skills in my teaching, learning, and assessment during my first year at Hull

- The second case study <a href="https://www.silviofanzon.com/assets/pdf/news/2024/Fanzon_Case_Study_2.pdf">(Link)</a> provides insights into how I have supported individual students, including my experience of co-authoring a paper with a Hull undergraduate student: <a href="/publications/#2024-Fry-Bri-Fan">Faster identification of faster Formula 1 drivers via time-rank duality</a>
