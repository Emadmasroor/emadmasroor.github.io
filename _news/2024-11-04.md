Our paper <a href="/publications/#2024-Fry-Aus-Fan">Elementary econometric and strategic analysis of curling matches</a> has
been published on <b>Managerial Finance</b>. We develop a Markov model of curling matches, parametrised by the probability of winning an end and the probability distribution of scoring ends. Using a maximum entropy argument, we predict that the points distribution of scoring ends should follow a constrained geometric distribution.
