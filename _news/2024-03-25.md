Our paper <a href="/publications/#2024-Fry-Bri-Fan">Faster identification of faster Formula 1 drivers via time-rank duality</a> has
been published on <b>Economics Letters</b>. We provide a novel approach to estimate race-winning probabilities, which leads to new insights regarding driver-level versus car-level effects, as well as a simplified Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. The paper can be found <a href="https://www.silviofanzon.com/assets/pdf/journal/2024-Fry-Bri-Fan.pdf">here</a>. The annotated R code to reproduce the findings is <a href="https://sfanzon.github.io/F1-Paper-Code/">here</a>
