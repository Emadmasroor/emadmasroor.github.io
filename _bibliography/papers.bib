abstract = {Upon further examination, we have determined that the streamline patterns in figure 3 of Basu & Stremler (2017) are not shown in the co-moving frame as intended; the ide ntical error was also made in figure 4(C–F) of Basu & Stremler (2015) and figure 3.3(C–F) of Basu (2014). The vortex positions and strength ratios used in these figures do correctly correspond to equilibrium configurations that translate uniformly without relative motion, but the equations used to generate the corresponding flow patterns contained an error that resulted in streamlines being determined in a frame of reference for which the vortices move uniformly instead of remaining stationary. The equations governing passive particle motion, which were not included in these publications, are shown here for clarity.},

abstract = {An inclined gravity-driven soap film channel was used to study the wake patterns formed behind a transversely oscillating cylinder at Re=235±14. The natural frequency of vortex shedding from a stationary cylinder, fSt, was used to identify the oscillation frequencies of interest. The (dimensionless) frequency, f∗=f∕fSt, and amplitude, A∗=A∕D, of the cylinder's motion was varied over a large portion of the fundamental synchronization region (i.e., for f∗≈1), and a ‘map' of wake patterns was constructed in (f∗,A∗) space. Lock-on between the frequency of the cylinder's motion and the dominant frequency of the resulting vortex wake was observed for a large range of this parameter space, predominantly manifested as synchronized ‘2S' and ‘2P' wake modes. Synchronized ‘P+S', ‘2T', and ‘transitional' wakes were also found in smaller regions of parameter space. Unsynchronized ‘coalescing' and ‘perturbed von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n' wakes were observed as the oscillation frequency became sufficiently different from fSt. The wake patterns and vortex formation processes found in this study, particularly the 2P mode wakes, bear a strong resemblance to previous three-dimensional experimental results, despite the physical constraint from the soap film that limits three-dimensional effects in the wake.},

@article{Masroor2022,
abstract = {The fluid motion produced by a periodic array of identical, axisymmetric, thin-cored vortex rings is investigated. It is well known that such an array moves uniformly without change of shape or form in the direction of the central axis of symmetry, and is therefore an equilibrium solution of Euler's equations. In a frame of reference moving together with the system of vortex rings, the motion of passive fluid particles is investigated as a function of the two non-dimensional parameters that define this system: {\$}\backslashvarepsilon = a/R{\$}, the ratio of minor radius to major radius of the torus-shaped vortex rings, and {\$}\backslashlambda = L/R{\$}, the separation of the vortex rings normalized by their radii. Two bifurcations in the streamline topology are found that depend significantly on {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}; these bifurcations delineate three distinct shapes of the 'atmosphere' of fluid particles that move together with the vortex ring for all time. Analogous to the case of an isolated vortex ring, the atmospheres can be 'thin-bodied' or 'thick-bodied'. Additionally, we find the occurrence of a 'connected' system, in which the atmospheres of neighboring rings touch at an invariant ring of fluid particles that is stationary in a frame of reference moving with the rings.},

abstract = {This article contains flow visualization data from experiments conducted in an inclined gravity-driven soap film intersected by a circular cylinder undergoing controlled transverse oscillations at a Reynolds number of $Re \approx 235$ . The dimensionless frequency and amplitude of cylinder oscillation were varied systematically over the ranges $0.2 < f^* < 1.8$ and $0.1 < A^* < 1.3$. A high-speed camera was used to capture the interference fringe patterns reflected from the soap film. These videos show the structure of the wake behind the cylinder, including the initial formation of vortices and the extended ‘vortex street’. Several wake patterns were identified, including the classic 2S, P+S, 2P, and 2T patterns, which are discussed in detail in the accompanying research article titled "The wake of a transversely oscillating circular cylinder in a flowing soap film at low Reynolds number" [1]. The videos presented in this article can be accessed through the Virginia Tech University Libraries’ Repository at https://doi.org/10.7294/14448027.v5 [2].},

abstract="We introduce a new definition of vortex formation length for uniform steady flow past a circular cylinder using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the pressure field. Previous definitions each identify a single characteristic length for a given value of Reynolds number. We use the leading modes of the pressure POD to define upper and lower bounds on the vortex formation length. Identifying a range for the vortex formation length is consistent with the hysteresis observed in the critical spacing of two tandem cylinders.",
