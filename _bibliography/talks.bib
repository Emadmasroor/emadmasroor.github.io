abstract = { When a circular cylinder oscillates with respect to a uniform background flow, a variety of vortex wake patterns are observed as a function of the oscillation amplitude and frequency.  Williamson and collaborators have determined pattern bifurcations in parameter space for 3D water flows with Re>300; Leontini and collaborators have studied the problem using a 2D computational method, which is physically relevant for Re<200.  There are several differences between these prior computational and experimental results.  We will present results of an ongoing experimental study of the wake structure produced by a circular cylinder undergoing forced oscillations transverse to the background flow in an inclined soap film system with Re<200.  Wake patterns are observed directly and clearly via the interference fringes caused by thickness variations in the soap film.  Comparisons will be made with the previous studies, and features of the two-dimensional experimental wake behavior will be explored.},

abstract = {We develop analytical expressions for the drag experienced in a uniform flow by a bluff body shedding a 2P wake. Following von Karman's well-known method for the drag experienced by a fixed cylinder with a typical `von Karman street'-type wake, we set up a potential flow past a general bluff body and model its wake as an infinite periodic collection of point vortices with 4 vortices per period. The relative positions of the 4 vortices are calculated by determining the relative equilibrium configurations of 2P wakes. By considering the momentum flux into and out of a rectangular region enclosing the body and cutting through the wake, we determine the drag forces exerted on the cylinder over one period of vortex shedding. The drag coefficients predicted by this method will be compared to those predicted for objects shedding a standard von Karman street, giving insight into the effect of wake type on the drag. },

abstract = {The flow patterns that form in the wake of an oscillating cylinder give us important information about the nature and extent of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of cylindrical structures such as oil risers, power lines and undersea cables. To investigate these patterns at low Reynolds number, we oscillated a circular cylinder transversely to a uniform free stream in a gravity-driven soap film over a large portion of the frequency-amplitude parameter space and visualized the resulting wakes using a high-speed camera. A rich variety of vortex patterns were found in the primary synchronization region of the parameter space, including the 2S, 2P, P+S, 2T and coalescing wake patterns. The presence of 2P wakes in a (nominally) two-dimensional flow suggests that spanwise instabilities in the cylinder wake are not necessary for the formation a 2P wake, since these instabilities are suppressed in our experiments. We will discuss these results, as well as the results of a follow-up study involving the oscillation of an extremely thin circular disk, instead of a cylinder, which was conducted to test alternative hypotheses for the formation of the 2P wake.},

abstract = {Th. von Karman showed that the time-averaged drag force on a submerged body producing a 2S vortex wake can be estimated by the features of a representative point vortex model. We generalize this approach, giving drag forces estimates for bluff bodies producing exotic wakes with N>2 vortices per period. The analysis consists primarily of a linear momentum balance applied to spatially periodic point vortex systems moving in relative equilibrium. Linear stability of some exotic vortex street equilibria help justify this approach. Drag force estimates are presented for 'P+S' (N=3) and '2P' (N=4) vortex wakes, and comparisons are made with the classic '2S' drag estimate. },

abstract = {We propose a low-order computational method for simulating the fluid-structure interaction of 2D thin flexible fins immersed in a fluid at high Reynolds number. We use the panel method to discretize a bound vortex sheet representing the fin, and update its strength over time using the unsteady form of Bernoulliâ€™s equation. A free vortex sheet is released from the trailing edge according to the unsteady Kutta condition. To satisfy the no-penetration boundary condition at each time step, we use a novel acceleration constraint to render the entire system of equations explicit in time, removing the need for iterative solution of a linear system in previous methods. This renders our method computationally efficient, and *more* effectively able to scale to large numbers of filaments compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate the application of our method to the dynamics of a single flexible fin with variable thickness along its length, subjected to prescribed, time-periodic, simultaneous heave and pitch motion of the leading edge, and calculate coefficients of efficiency and thrust.},

abstract = { It is well known that a spatially-periodic array of identical, axisymmetric, thin-cored vortex rings moves uniformly without change of shape or form in the direction of the central axis of symmetry, and is an equilibrium solution of Euler's equations. We revisit this classical result, due to Vasilev (1914), using the modern formalism of Borisov et. al (2013). In a frame of reference moving with the system of vortex rings, the motion of passive fluid particles is investigated as a function of the two nondimensional parameters that define this system: Îµ=a/R, the ratio of minor radius to major radius of the torus-shaped vortex rings, and Î»=L/R, the separation of the vortex rings normalized by their radii. Two bifurcations in the streamline topology are found that depend significantly on Îµ and Î»; these bifurcations delineate three distinct shapes of the "atmosphere" of fluid particles that move together with the vortex ring for all time. Analogous to the case of an isolated vortex ring, the atmospheres can be "thin-bodied" or "thick-bodied". Additionally, we find the occurrence of a "connected" system, in which the atmospheres of neighboring rings touch at an invariant circle of fluid particles that is stationary in a frame of reference moving with the vortex rings. },
