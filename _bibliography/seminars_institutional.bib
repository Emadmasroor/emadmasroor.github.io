	abstract = {My final assignment presentation for the Curriculum Design module, part of the PCAP Programme at the University of Hull. I analyse the module Statistical Models which I taght in 2023/24, offering perspectives on how the curriculum aligns to the themes of Curricular Context, Assessment & Feedback Design, Inclusive & Decolonised curriculum, Sustainability and Global Competence. For each theme, I identify areas for enhancement and propose practical, literature-driven solutions for implementation. A comprehensive analysis of the cited literature can be found in the attached document, titled Annotated Bibliography.},
