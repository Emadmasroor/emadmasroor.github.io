@misc{2016-CMU,
	abbr = {CMU},
	abstract = {We propose and analyze a simple variational model for dislocations at semi-coherent interfaces. The energy functional describes  the competition between two terms: a surface energy induced by dislocations that compensate the lattice misfit at the interface,  and a far field elastic energy, spent to  decrease the amount of  needed dislocations. We prove that the former scales like the surface area of the interface, the latter like its diameter.  
<br>

The proposed continuum model is deduced from some heuristic derivation from the semi-discrete theory of dislocations. Even if we deal with finite elasticity, linearized elasticity naturally emerges in our analysis since the far field strain vanishes as the interface size increases.},
