one-homogeneous regularizer. We exploit the sparse structure of the variational problem by designing iterates as linear combinations of extremal points of the unit ball of the regularizer. For such iterates we prove global sublinear convergence of the algorithm. Then, under additional structural assumptions, we prove a local linear convergence rate.

	abbr = {Uni Graz},
	abstract = {In this talk I will present the results obtained in a recent paper in collaboration with Mariapia Palombaro and Marcello Ponsiglione. 
The aim of this paper is to describe polycrystalline structures from the variational point of view. Grain boundaries and the corresponding grain orientations are not introduced as internal variables of the energy, but they spontaneously arise as a result of energy minimisation, under suitable boundary conditions. 

<br>

We work under the hypothesis of linear planar elasticity, with the reference configuration \(\Omega \subset R^2 \, \) representing a section of an infinite cylindrical crystal. The elastic energy functional \(E_\varepsilon \, \) depends on the lattice spacing \(\varepsilon \,\) of the crystal and we allow \(N_\varepsilon \, \) edge dislocations in the reference configuration, with \(N_\varepsilon \to \infty \, \) as \(\varepsilon \to 0\). Each dislocation contributes by a factor \( | \log \varepsilon | \, \) to the elastic energy, so that the natural rescaling for the energy functional is \(N_\varepsilon | \log \varepsilon |  \). We work in the energy regime
\[
N_\varepsilon \gg |\log \varepsilon| .
\]
We will see that this energy regime will account for polycrystals containing grains that are mutually rotated by an infinitesimal angle \(\theta \approx 0\). 

<br>

Specifically, we show that the energy functional \(E_\varepsilon\), rescaled by \(N_\varepsilon |\log \varepsilon|\), \(\Gamma\)-converges as \(\varepsilon \to 0 \, \) to a certain functional \(F\), whose dependence on the elastic and plastic parts of the macroscopic strain is decoupled. 
Imposing piecewise constant Dirichlet boundary conditions on the plastic part of the limit strain, we then show that \( F  \, \) is minimised by strains that are locally constant and take values into the set of antisymmetric matrices. We call these strains linearised polycrystals.},

	abstract = {We will introduce variational models for edge dislocations at semi-coherent interfaces between two heterogeneous crystals, and prove the optimality of uniformly distributed edge dislocations. Specifically, we prove that, in the large interface limit, the elastic energy \(\Gamma\)-converges to a limit functional comprised of two contributions: one is given by a constant gauging the minimal energy induced by dislocations at the interface, and corresponding to a uniform distribution of edge dislocations; the other one accounts for the far field elastic energy induced by the presence of further, possibly not uniformly distributed, dislocations. After assuming periodic boundary conditions and formally considering the limit from semi-coherent to coherent interfaces, we show that the optimal configuration consists in evenly-spaced dislocations on the one dimensional circle.

only two elliptic matrices, i.e., \(\sigma \in \) &#123; \( \sigma_1,  \sigma_2 \) &#125; a.e. in \(\Omega\). In Nesi et al. (Ann Inst H Poincar{\'e} Anal Non Lin{\'e}aire 31(3):615--638, 2014),  for every pair of elliptic matrices \(\sigma_1\, \) and \(\sigma_2\, \),

\(p = p\)<sub>\(\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \)</sub> \( \in (0,+\infty) \, \) and 
\( q = q\)<sub>\(\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \)</sub>  \(\in (1,2)\, \) have been found so that if 
\(u \in W\)<sup>\(1,q\)</sup>  \( (\Omega) \, \) is a solution to the elliptic equation then 
\(\nabla u \in L^p(\Omega,weak)\, \)
and the optimality of the upper exponent \(p\, \) has been proved. In this paper we complement the above result by proving the optimality of the lower exponent \(q \). Precisely, we show that for every arbitrarily small \(\delta\), one can find a particular microgeometry, i.e., an arrangement of the sets 
\(\sigma\)<sup>\(-1 \)</sup> \( (\sigma_1)\, \) and 
\(\sigma\)<sup>\(-1 \)</sup> \( (\sigma_2)\, \), for which there exists a solution \(u \, \) to the corresponding elliptic equation such that 
\( \nabla u \in L\)<sup>\( q-\delta \)</sup> 
but \( \nabla u \notin L^q \). The existence of such optimal microgeometries is achieved by convex integration methods, adapting to the present setting the geometric constructions provided in Astala et al. (Ann Scuola Norm Sup Pisa Cl Sci 5(7):1--50, 2008) for the isotropic case.},
