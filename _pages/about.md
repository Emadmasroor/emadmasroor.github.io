<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.3rem"><b>About me</b></h3>

<div markdown="1">
I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor of Engineering at [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/). While my training is in mechancial engineering and engineering mechanics, I teach courses in a wide variety of fields including thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mechanics of materials, numerical methods, and dynamics.

I received my PhD in 2023 from the [Engineering Mechanics program](https://me.vt.edu/for-students/graduate/em.html){:target="\_blank"} at Virginia Tech, where I worked with Mark Stremler.

My research interests are in fluid mechanics; I study problems in classical vortex dynamics and its applications to biological locomotion, flow-induced vibrations, and energy harvesting. I conduct theoretical, numerical and experimental research in Singer Hall.
